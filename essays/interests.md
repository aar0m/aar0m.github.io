The classic adage,

> _“When in Rome, do as the Romans do”_

has guided individuals to be more adaptive and motivated when engaging in foreign customs/culture. Similarly, I found myself “doing as the Romans do” when finding my career aspirations and interests within software engineering. However, software engineering can be so broad and overarching that I could be referring to interests and roles that are completely independent of each other. This leads to my experience in discovering my interests and career aspirations, as well as how I came to realize,

> _“When in software engineering, do everything!”_


## How did we get here?

Before elaborating on this conclusion, it is important to understand my journey that led to this conclusion. As a child, I was more of a 'user' than a 'developer'---**playing** video games, **consuming** social media, and figuring out how to **use** digital illustration tools and 3D modeling programs. It was only near the end of my freshamn year in college did I feel the urge to take a deeper dive into the systems and processes that created all the software I used, which is no surprise for a computer engineering major. Despite my technical major, I still consider myself a creative and initially gravitated to the idea of _creating_ programs for some audience while developing software that implements style.

As such I began "doing as Romans do", and took a deep plunge into technical software concepts: learning different programming languages, researching the tech industry, and even ideating possible personal projects to work on. I had begun my endeavor to truly be a 'computer engineer' with the skills, experience, and knowledge to back it up.


## Alas, when in software engineering . . .

However, I soon found that "doing as Romans do" did not quite summarize my college experience. Sure, I attempted to think like software engineer and develop small projects with my own creative spin but I found my initial motivation of creatiion and design being derailed. Rather, experiencing cyber attacks and facing multiple inconveniences that stem from weak software security has pusehd me to be increasingly keen on maintaining the integrity and security of software.

Thus, I slowly found myself more involved in classes and projects related to cybersecurity, becoming more considerate of the robustness and integrity of various software. Moreover, the rise of generative artifical intelligence (AI) and its malicious capabilties---stealing, morphing, and replicating data---has only amplified these thoughts of securing software and user data. 


## . . . Do **everything**!

Despite my creative approach to software engineering, I was more interested the technical implementation of AI within software and subsequent cybersecurity. I now seek to learn more software engineering skills related to optimization, maintenance, and security, while being able to succesfull deploy projects usable by many. 

Of course, I will still jump at the opportuntiy to create stylish designs or implement aesthetics within final products but my perspective has increased beyond the scope of a creative; it is now reaching a more technical scope related to security and AI.

This epiphany made me realize that, in software engineering, emulating is only the first step; simply "doing as the Romans do" does not embody the spirit of software engineering. I can comfortably say that my journey hsa put me through so many areas of software engineering, from design and implementation to security, I realized that I was not doing just what "Romans" do---I was doing **everything**, and personally believe myself to be a better engineer because of it. So instead of a limited mindset, I now prefer to explore new fields and attempt new challenges as a means of expanding my perspective, toolbox, and skillset. So remember,
